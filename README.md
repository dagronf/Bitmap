A Swift-y convenience for loading/saving and manipulating bitmap images.

## Why?

I wanted a simple Swift interface for wrapping some of the common image manipulations
that I come across in my day-to-day image needs, the primary being easily being able to draw directly into a
bitmap image.

* Supports all Apple platforms (with some limitations on watchOS)
* supports loading non-RGBA format images (eg. CMYK) by converting the image to RGBA during load.
* objects are easily saved via its `representation` property.
* supports both mutable and immutable methods (functional-style) for manipulating bitmaps.
* bitmap manipulation functions
* `Sendable` support to push bitmap information between tasks.

## Definitions

The `Bitmap` object represents an RGBA image. The image data is stored internally in a simple 1-D array of bytes
representing the R,G,B,A sequence of pixels. 

The bitmap object holds and manages a `CGContext` representation of the bitmap to allow CG- operations directly 
on the bitmap itself. 

* `Bitmap`s coordinate system starts at (0, 0) in the bottom left. 
* All operations/manipulations/coordinates occur from the bottom left.

## Creating a new image

Nice and simple :-)

```swift
var bitmap = try Bitmap(width: 640, height: 480)
```

## Loading an image into a Bitmap

Supports any file formats that `NSImage`, `UIImage` and `CGImageSource` support when loading.

```swift
// From a file...
var bitmap = try Bitmap(fileURL: ...)

// From image data
var bitmap = try Bitmap(imageData: ...)
```

## Saving a bitmap

Supports any file formats that `NSImage`, `UIImage` and `CGImageSource` support when saving.

`Bitmap` provides methods for writing to some different formats, such as `png`.
The `representation` property on the bitmap contains the methods for generating
image data in different formats

```swift
var bitmap = try Bitmap(fileURL: ...)
...
let pngData = bitmap.representation?.png()
```

## Drawing into a bitmap

### Drawing into the bitmap's context using CG methods

```swift
var bitmap = try Bitmap(width: 640, height: 480)
bitmap.draw { ctx in
   ctx.setFillColor(.black)
   ctx.fill([CGRect(x: 5, y: 5, width: 20, height: 20)])
}
```

### Drawing an image into the bitmap

```swift
var bitmap = try Bitmap(width: 640, height: 480)
// Draw an image into a defined rectangle (with optional scaling types aspectFit, aspectFill, axes independent)
bitmap.drawImage(image, in: CGRect(x: 50, y: 50, width: 100, height: 100))
// Draw a bitmap at a point
bitmap.drawBitmap(bitmap, at: CGPoint(x: 300, y: 300))
```

## Getting/setting individual pixels

You can directly access pixel information in the bitmap using subscripts or the get/setPixel methods on `Bitmap`

```swift
var bitmap = Bitmap(...)

// Retrieve the color of the pixel at x = 4, y = 3.
let rgbaPixel = bitmap[4, 3]   // or bitmap.getPixel(x: 4, y: 3)

// Set the color of the pixel at x = 4, y = 3. Only available when `bitmap` is mutable
bitmap[4, 3] = Bitmap.RGBA(r: 255, g: 0, b: 0, a: 255)   // or bitmap.setPixel(x: 4, y: 3, ...)
```

## Bitmap operations

`Bitmap` provides a number of built-in operations (such as rotate, tint) that operate on a `Bitmap` instance. 

### Mutable

Mutable functions operate on a Bitmap variable. Each method modifies the original bitmap instance.

```swift
// Load an image, rotate it and convert it to grayscale
var bitmap = try Bitmap(fileURL: ...)
try bitmap.rotate(by: 1.4)
try bitmap.grayscale()
```

### Immutable

Immutable functions work on a copy of the bitmap and return the copy. The original bitmap (which can be a `let` variable
remains untouched.

Immutable function variations are named with 'ing' in the title, such as `tinting()` or `scaling()`.

```swift
// Load an image, rotate it and convert it to grayscale
let bitmap = try Bitmap(fileURL: ...)
let rotated = try bitmap.rotating(by: 1.4)
let grayscale = try rotated.grayscaling()
```

This allows functional-style chaining on a bitmap.

```swift
// Functional style
let bitmap = try Bitmap(fileURL: ...)
	.rotating(by: 1.4)
	.grayscaling()
```

### Available bitmap manipulation functions

* Resizing/scaling
* Padding/inset
* Clipping/masking
* Rotation
* Scrolling
* Transparency removal
* Punching holes
* Color manipulation (eg. grayscale, tinting, gamma adjustment, saturation etc)
* Flipping
* Drawing (eg. lines, shapes, paths, fill/stroke)
* Drawing text
* Drawing borders

â€¦ and more!

## Sendable support

You will not be able to directly send a `Bitmap` object between Tasks.
This is due to `Bitmap` internally caching a `CGContext` instance in order to increase performance and 
reduce the memory footprint.

Internally, `Bitmap` keeps pixel information inside a `Bitmap.RGBAData` object which conforms to `Sendable`. 
This object can be passed safely between tasks and are easily reconstituted into a new `Bitmap` object.

```swift
var myBitmap = try Bitmap(...)
let bitmapData = myBitmap.bitmapData

// Pass `bitmapData` to another Task

var myBitmap = try Bitmap(bitmapData)
```
